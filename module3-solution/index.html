<!--Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls 
  away together with the page (the navbar should become invisible 
  and is not fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). 
  The navbar should have a company name (i.e., navbar-brand class) 
  called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. 
  (See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar. 
  Make the browser window narrower to see the mobile menu button 
  appear in the first example shown at the provided link.) -->

          <p>The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked
            before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing.
            It is, essentially, as the title implies, a guide book. The
            problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a
            sizeable portion of which are continually clogging up the civil,
            commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and
            especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this.
            The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem.
            This is: Change.</p>

          <p>Humans are bipedal ape descendants from the planet Earth.
            Not noted for being particularly bright, up until they are destroyed,
            if they even manage to do that much correctly, they actually still think
            that digital watches are a pretty neat idea, and they spend most of their time concerning
            themselves with moving about little green pieces of paper. On the bright side,
            they are rather adept at adapting to just about any situation that the universe tosses at them.
            For a short time the last two humans left in the universe, following Earth's
            destruction by the Vogons, were Trillian, who had left the Earth some time before
            its destruction with Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Arthur Dent, who escaped the Earth's
            demolition with a man whom he thought to be human, but wasn't.

            The number went up to three for a while, as they had a daughter called Random Dent.
            Unfortunately, they were all killed in the events of Mostly Harmless. .</p>

          <p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's definition of "Universe":
            The Universe is a very big thing that contains a great number of planets and a
            great number of beings. It is Everything. What we live in. All around us.
            The lot. Not nothing. It is quite difficult to actually define what the Universe means,
            but fortunately the Guide doesn't worry about that and just gives us some useful information to live in it.

            Area: The area of the Universe is infinite.

            Imports: None. This is a by product of infinity; it is
            impossible to import things into something that has infinite
            volume because by definition there is no outside to import things from.

            Exports: None, for similar reasons as imports.

            Population: None. Although you might see people from time to time,
            they are most likely products of your imagination. Simple mathematics tells us
            that the population of the Universe must be zero. Why? Well given that the volume of
            the universe is infinite there must be an infinite number of worlds. But not all of them are populated;
            therefore only a finite number are. Any finite number divided by infinity is zero, therefore the average
            population of the Universe is zero, and so the total population must be zero.

            Art: None. Because the function of art is to hold a mirror up to nature there can be no art
            because the Universe is infinite which means there simply isn't a mirror big enough.

            Sex: None. Although in fact there is quite a lot, given the zero population of the Universe
            there can in fact be no beings to have sex, and therefore no sex happens in the Universe </p>
